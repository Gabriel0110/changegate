## Why It Matters

Public exposure changes can create reachable entrypoints. ChangeGate reports this when the plan or graph evidence is strong enough to show the exposure path.

## Remediation

- Remove public CIDRs unless internet access is required.
- Prefer private subnets, internal load balancers, or authenticated edge controls.
- Document any intentional public exposure in policy or a time-bounded waiver.

## References

- No external references.
